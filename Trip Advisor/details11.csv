Could be glorious

This is a part of the famous ITC chain affiliated to the SPG. It is named after the great rulers across the Mumbai area. It is very close to the airport but far from South Mumbai offices but about 45 minutes from the BKC new hub.It is among several hotels all cheek by jowl near the airport. It has competition form them as well as its own sister hotel ITC Central.It does not come off that well. It has more attitude and less service.Their recognition of SPG status was inadequate.its rooms are OK but service is lacklustre. The breakfast hall looks good but is too small and staff untrained to handle the larger number of guests with finesse. They proclaim much will be served at the table but unlike other hotels the staff will make you wait and force you to go and get it yourself. the front office is also very lackadaisical and seems to think guests will just come each time whatever you may do.well they wont!Greta location and style but lacks what is needed...service
