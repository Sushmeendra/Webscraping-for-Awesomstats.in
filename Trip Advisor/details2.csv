Disappointed with the stay Feb 22 - 24
<---COMMENT TEXT--->
"Hi,This is to register my disappointment and displeasure from my 2 night stay at ITC Maratha.Having booked a double bed, my 6ft tired self from the hour and a half delayed flight, was looking forward to getting a decent shut eye.At the hotel, was greeted to a we only have single beds Sir! Well, that doesn't work with me. As if I had a choice at that close to midnight hour anyways.In the room, 1182, I think, we continue with being underwhelmed. While the In room dining menu wasn't easy to find, of course there weren't any fruits or chocolates to compensate. Magazines were stacked upside down!Next morning, we continue with the bad run- the toilet water can't be closed shut, the shower glass area has proper scratches at eye level. And the worst, the hair dryer is an excuse to save money it seems! And it didn't work, not to miss our house keeping friend who suggested, well Sir it works sometimes! For someone who's got to get to work, sometimes is just not good enough.Ah, the mirrors are just too far and don't have enough light on them.The hangers were marked in permanent marker, carried another room's number, obviously so they may not get stolen. Well remind me, which hotel are we talking about again?Maybe I'm looking for too much perfection, but that's what I expect of your hotels ITC. Do let me know, if you'd like me to lower my expectations.To be fair, the breakfast is so much better, though service there's patchy as well. If you really must know, do check my Zomato post.To be fair, was offered a king sized bed for the next morning, which I did accept. The upgrade was nice too, but again, nothing that made you feel someone felt your pain, or made you feel special.Am traveling again this week, staying at Westin.Be traveling soon again. Would like if we surprise, to the positive!Regards, Umang"
