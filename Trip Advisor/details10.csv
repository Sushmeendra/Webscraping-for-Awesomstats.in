Beautiful hotel with great staff
<---COMMENT TEXT--->
I was stranded in Mumbai recently because of bad weather in Ireland. Luckily I had been staying in the ITC Maratha hotel.  They booked me straight back in and sent a car to pick me up from the airport. Staff were very attentive and couldnâ€™t have done more to make my unexpected stay more comfortable. The accommodation and food are excellent.  The staff are amazing. Much appreciated.
