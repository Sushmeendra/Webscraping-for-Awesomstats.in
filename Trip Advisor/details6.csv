<---COMMENT TEXT--->
"In the past year I have traveled to Mumbai, India twice and this time around I stayed at ITC Maratha near the airport.  As soon as you entered the compound we were greeted and escorted. The front office manager, kudrat and Jasleen - took care of us immediately and had our keys ready.  Very professional and Courteous and wanting to help in any way possible to make your stay comfortable.  The interior is spectacular with a 16 story high atrium.  The hotel is very spacious and top of the line aminities.  I would be remiss if I did not write about world class chefs.  They absouletly served the most delicious breakfast each morning awakening my senses to all flavors and tastes.  I am impressed and will stay here again on my next visit. I highly recommend ITC Maratha"
