"My favorite among most of ITC properties.Located in the close vicinity of T2 of Chatrapati Shivaji Intl Airport,MUMBAI  offers a perfect blend of luxury and excellent service.When said responsible luxury it has been awarded a platinum rating under LEED  EB Program. The building is again a blend of ethnic Indian and European architecture with plush interiors exhibiting the coadunation of the old and the contemporary.As an expression of the traditional age old cuisine it serves a culinary nostalgia for those connoisseurs yearning for authentic dinning experience. A business hotel with a social mind !!Strongly recommended for an actual hands on experience"
