Would definitely stay here again!
<---COMMENT TEXT--->
"We had a day of transit travel in Mumbai, and we had been recommended the ITC Maratha as a good place to stay. Glad that we ended up here - great service, comfortable rooms, and great food. We lucked out in them having a pre-Holi party to celebrate, and my kids were able to play Holi in India (a first for them!) A few tips: 1) Make reservations at the restaurants for dinner - they get busy. 2) The hotel car arrange for car service pick up / drop off. It is a little more expensive than Uber or local Taxi, but nice to have someone waiting for you at the airport.  3) If you need anything for your small child - just ask. They brought us milk, snacks, and fruit for our kids - no questions asked. No charge.  4) Let them know if you've got odd arrival times, and they will work to accomodate if possible - i.e. we arrived at 11:30 am and were checking out that same night at 1:15 am, and our room was ready when we arrived.  5) Check out the Spa - I was able to sneak in a 90 minute massage in my short stay. Schedules are flexible and plenty of options to suit your budget and time."
